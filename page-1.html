              The Rubik's Cube finally hits stores! ...Only in Budapest. And it's not the "Rubik's Cube" yet, at the moment it is called "Büvös Kocka", which is Hungarian for "Magic Cube". Bonus fun fact: Chinese cube manufacturers still call their cubes "Magic Cube".

              The first world Rubik's Cube championships is held in Budapest, the birthplace of the cube. American Minh Thai was victorious with a fastest single solve of 22.95 seconds. This is often considered the first official Rubik's Cube world record. Another official competition would not be held until 2003.

              Dutch Erik Akkersdijk completes the first solve under 10 seconds in competition, setting the world record for a single solve with a 9.77. This record would be broken many times in the next 14 years, but regardless, it was a huge milestone.

              Release of the Dayan Zhanchi. This was the first cube that was universally accepted as better than the official Rubik's branded cube. It was used to break many world records and set the standard for serious solvers to use higher quality "knock-off" cubes.

              Lucas Etter completes the first official solve in under 5 seconds: an unbelievable 4.90 second time. The world record had already been broken twice before at that same competition, so there must have been some sort of good luck charm at the venue.
