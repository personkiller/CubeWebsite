			<td>
				You can solve the cube with only two moves repeated over and over.
			</td>
			<td>
				False. You have likely been tricked by a cleverly shot Youtube video
				where the creator has covered the already mostly solved part of the
				cube. The creator has also most likely already repeated the reverse of
				those moves a couple of times and then simply undone them. So no, you
				cannot solve any scramble in 2 moves.
			</td>

		<tr>
			<td>
				Every living person has a cousin who can solve the Rubik's Cube in 2
				seconds.
			</td>
			<td>
				A surprising... <b>Myth!</b> There is a very, very low chance of this
				and it is only true if you are cousins with any of these people: Max
				Park, Tymon Kolakinski, or Ruihang Xu.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>There's a really easy trick to solving it right?</td>
			<td>
				There is no single trick to solving the cube, but you could learn how to
				solve it in around 45 minutes with the right tutorial, like
				<a class="table-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ron6MN45LY"

				Solvers of the Rubik's Cube use varying methods that consist of several
				intuitive steps as well as algorithmic sections. The definition of
				algorithm within cubing is a little bit different from the math or
				computer science definition. In cubing, they're just memorized sequences
				of moves. You only need two or three to solve the cube, but a staggering
				80 are standard for advanced speedsolvers and upwards of 1000 for expert
				solvers.
			</td>
			<td>
				This is actually very accurate. Yeah, good job whoever wrote this.
				*toots own horn* To contribute something to this, I will add that
				algorithms can be discovered either by intuition/trial and error, clever
				group theory, or computer. Cubers usually will learn these algorithms by
				using muscle memory and breaking each sequence of moves into common
				smaller squences called tiggers.

		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>You have to be good at math to solve the Rubik's Cube.</td>
			<td>
				False. Anybody, including you, could search up a tutorial on youtube
				right now, pay close attention and have the cube solved in less than an
				hour. Simple methods have been developed for beginners that minimize
				memorization and require little intuition.

	<h1>Now here's some quick random facts about the cube.</h1>
	<ul class="more-facts">
		<li>
			Every state of the cube can be solved within 20 moves. This was found with
			a combination of clever math and brute force over at google.
		</li>
		<li>
			The person with the most official Rubik's Cube world records is Felik's
			Zemdegs with 121 records across multiple events over the course of 12
			years.
		</li>
		<li>
			Most serious speedcubers (people who solve the cube fast) don't use a
			Rubik's branded cube, and instead use Chinese cubes with technology like
			spring compression and magnets with adjustable strength.
		</li>
		<li>
			The World Cube Association (WCA) regulates all official Rubik's Cube
			competitions and allow competitors to compete in 18 different events. If
			you're interested in the WCA, click
			<a href="https://www.worldcubeassociation.org">this link.</a>
		</li>
		<li>
			There is a sequence of move called the "Devil's Algorithm" that will solve
			any permutation of the 3x3 cube by cycling through every single one of
			them. This sequence will be mutiple quintillion moves long if it is
			somehow found, but at the very least it has been found for the 2x2 cube.
