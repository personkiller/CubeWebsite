        <header>5 Things We Need to Clarify About the Rubik's Cube</header>

        <p class="skinny-text black-border">
            Despite the fact the Rubik’s cube is one of the most popular toys of all
            time, a lot of people don’t know much about it and what they do know is
            often a myth. There are so many easily debunk-able "facts" that are spread
            around that are better off clarified (mostly for my own sanity.) So, this article
            will cover what you think you know about the Rubik’s Cube and why you are a stupid
            dumb idiot for thinking that. &#128516 <!--smily face emoji-->

            <li>&emsp;Yes, I am good at math, but that's not related to solving cubes.</li>
            <li>&emsp;Your cousin did not solve it in 2 seconds.</li>
            <li>&emsp;No I didn't cheat.</li>
            <li>&emsp;Peeling the stickers off is not noteworthy.</li>
            <li>&emsp;No that is not a 10 by 10.</li>
            <li>
                &emsp;If I could memorize the moves you used to scramble the cube,
                <br/>&emsp;I would be at the world championships, not in class.
